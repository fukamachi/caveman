# Caveman2 - Lightweight web application framework

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fukamachi/caveman.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fukamachi/caveman)

## Usage

```common-lisp
(defparameter *web* (make-instance '<app>))

@route GET "/"
(defun index ()
  (render #P"index.tmpl"))

@route GET "/hello"
(defun say-hello (&key (|name| "Guest"))
  (format nil "Hello, ~A" |name|))
```

## About Caveman2

### What's different from Caveman "1"?

Everything. Caveman2 was written from scratch.

These are noteworthy points.

* Is based on [ningle](http://8arrow.org/ningle/)
* Has database integration
* Uses new, separate configuration system ([Envy](https://github.com/fukamachi/envy))
* Has new routing macro

### The reason I wrote it from scratch:

One of the most frequently asked questions was "Which should I use: ningle or Caveman? What are the differences?" I think these were asked so frequently because Caveman and ningle were too similar. Both of them are called "micro", and had no database support.

With Caveman2, Caveman is no longer a "micro" web application framework. It supports CL-DBI, and has database connection management by default. Caveman has started growing up.

## Design Goal

Caveman is intended to be a collection of common parts of web applications. With Caveman2, I use three rules to make decisions:

* Be extensible.
* Be practical.
* Don't force anything.

## Quickstart

You came here because you're interested in living like a caveman, right? This isn't Disneyland, but we can start here. Let's get into a cave!

### Installation

Caveman2 is now available on [Quicklisp](https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/).

```common-lisp
(ql:quickload :caveman2)
```

### Generating a project skeleton

```common-lisp
(caveman2:make-project #P"/path/to/myapp/"
                       :author "<Your full name>")
;-> writing /path/to/myapp/.gitignore
;   writing /path/to/myapp/README.markdown
;   writing /path/to/myapp/app.lisp
;   writing /path/to/myapp/db/schema.sql
;   writing /path/to/myapp/shlyfile.lisp
;   writing /path/to/myapp/myapp-test.asd
;   writing /path/to/myapp/myapp.asd
;   writing /path/to/myapp/src/config.lisp
;   writing /path/to/myapp/src/db.lisp
;   writing /path/to/myapp/src/main.lisp
;   writing /path/to/myapp/src/view.lisp
;   writing /path/to/myapp/src/web.lisp
;   writing /path/to/myapp/static/css/main.css
;   writing /path/to/myapp/t/myapp.lisp
;   writing /path/to/myapp/templates/_errors/404.html
;   writing /path/to/myapp/templates/index.tmpl
;   writing /path/to/myapp/templates/layout/default.tmpl
```

### Start a server
This is an example that assumes that the name of your application is "myapp".
Before starting the server, you must first load your app.

```common-lisp
(ql:quickload :myapp)
```

Your application has functions named `start` and `stop` to start/stop your web application. 

```common-lisp
(myapp:start :port 8080)
```

As Caveman is based on Clack/Lack, you can choose which server to run on -- Hunchentoot, Woo or Wookie, etc.

```common-lisp
(myapp:start :server :hunchentoot :port 8080)
(myapp:start :server :fcgi :port 8080)
```

I recommend you use Hunchentoot on a local machine, and use Woo in a production environment.

You can also start your application by using [clackup command](https://github.com/fukamachi/clack/blob/master/roswell/clackup.ros).

    $ ros install clack
    $ which clackup
    /Users/nitro_idiot/.roswell/bin/clackup

    $ APP_ENV=development clackup --server :fcgi --port 8080 app.lisp

### Routing

Caveman2 provides 2 ways to define a route -- `@route` and `defroute`. You can use either.

`@route` is an annotation macro, defined by using [cl-annot](https://github.com/arielnetworks/cl-annot). It takes a method, a URL-string, and a function.

```common-lisp
;; in src/web.lisp
@route GET "/"
(defun index ()
  ...)

;; A route with no name.
@route GET "/welcome"
(lambda (&key (|name| "Guest"))
  (format nil "Welcome, ~A" |name|))
```

This is similar to Caveman1's `@url` except for its argument list. You don't have to specify an argument when it is not required.

`defroute` is just a macro. It provides the same functionality as `@route`.

```common-lisp
(defroute index "/" ()
  ...)

;; A route with no name.
(defroute "/welcome" (&key (|name| "Guest"))
  (format nil "Welcome, ~A" |name|))
```

Since Caveman bases on ningle, Caveman also has the [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/)-like routing system.

```common-lisp
;; GET request (default)
@route GET "/" (lambda () ...)
(defroute ("/" :method :GET) () ...)

;; POST request
@route POST "/" (lambda () ...)
(defroute ("/" :method :POST) () ...)

;; PUT request
@route PUT "/" (lambda () ...)
(defroute ("/" :method :PUT) () ...)

;; DELETE request
@route DELETE "/" (lambda () ...)
(defroute ("/" :method :DELETE) () ...)

;; OPTIONS request
@route OPTIONS "/" (lambda () ...)
(defroute ("/" :method :OPTIONS) () ...)

;; For all methods
@route ANY "/" (lambda () ...)
(defroute ("/" :method :ANY) () ...)
```

Route patterns may contain "keywords" to put the value into the argument.

```common-lisp
(defroute "/hello/:name" (&key name)
  (format nil "Hello, ~A" name))
```

The above controller will be invoked when you access "/hello/Eitaro" or "/hello/Tomohiro", and `name` will be "Eitaro" or "Tomohiro", as appropriate.

`(&key name)` is almost same as a lambda list of Common Lisp, except it always allows other keys.

```common-lisp
(defroute "/hello/:name" (&rest params &key name)
  ;; ...
  )
```

Route patterns may also contain "wildcard" parameters. They are accessible by using `splat`.

```common-lisp
(defroute "/say/*/to/*" (&key splat)
  ; matches /say/hello/to/world
  (format nil "~A" splat))
;=> (hello world)

(defroute "/download/*.*" (&key splat)
  ; matches /download/path/to/file.xml
  (format nil "~A" splat)) 
;=> (path/to/file xml)
```

If you'd like to write use a regular expression in a URL rule, `:regexp t` should work.

```common-lisp
(defroute ("/hello/([\\w]+)" :regexp t) (&key captures)
  (format nil "Hello, ~A!" (first captures)))
```

Normally, routes are tested for a match in the order they are defined, and only the first route matched is invoked, with the following routes being ignored. However, a route can continue testing for matches in the list, by including `next-route`.

```common-lisp
(defroute "/guess/:who" (&key who)
  (if (string= who "Eitaro")
      "You got me!"
      (next-route)))

(defroute "/guess/*" ()
  "You missed!")
```

You can return following formats as the result of `defroute`.

* String
* Pathname
* Clack's response list (containing Status, Headers and Body)

### Redirection

Redirect to another route with`(redirect "url")`. A second optional argument is the status code, 302 by default.

### Reverse URLs

When you defined routes with names, you can find the URL from a name with `(url-for route-name &rest params)`.

The function will throw an error if no route is found.

### More helper functions

See also:

- `add-query-parameters base-url params`


### Structured query/post parameters

Parameter keys containing square brackets ("[" & "]") will be parsed as structured parameters. You can access the parsed parameters as `_parsed` in routers.

```html
<form action="/edit">
  <input type="name" name="person[name]" />
  <input type="name" name="person[email]" />
  <input type="name" name="person[birth][year]" />
  <input type="name" name="person[birth][month]" />
  <input type="name" name="person[birth][day]" />
</form>
```

```common-lisp
(defroute "/edit" (&key _parsed)
  (format nil "~S" (cdr (assoc "person" _parsed :test #'string=))))
;=> "((\"name\" . \"Eitaro\") (\"email\" . \"e.arrows@gmail.com\") (\"birth\" . ((\"year\" . 2000) (\"month\" . 1) (\"day\" . 1))))"

;; With assoc-utils
(ql:quickload :assoc-utils)
(import 'assoc-utils:aget)
(defroute "/edit" (&key _parsed)
  (format nil "~S" (aget _parsed "person")))
```

Blank keys mean they have multiple values.

```html
<form action="/add">
  <input type="text" name="items[][name]" />
  <input type="text" name="items[][price]" />

  <input type="text" name="items[][name]" />
  <input type="text" name="items[][price]" />

  <input type="submit" value="Add" />
</form>
```

```common-lisp
(defroute "/add" (&key _parsed)
  (format nil "~S" (assoc "items" _parsed :test #'string=)))
;=> "(((\"name\" . \"WiiU\") (\"price\" . \"30000\")) ((\"name\" . \"PS4\") (\"price\" . \"69000\")))"
```

### Templates

Caveman uses [Djula](http://mmontone.github.io/djula/djula/) as its default templating engine.

```html
{% extends "layouts/default.html" %}
{% block title %}Users | MyApp{% endblock %}
{% block content %}
<div id="main">
  <ul>
  {% for user in users %}
    <li><a href="{{ user.url }}">{{ user.name }}</a></li>
  {% endfor %}
  </ul>
</div>
{% endblock %}
```

```common-lisp
(import 'myapp.view:render)

(render #P"users.html"
        '(:users ((:url "/id/1"
                   :name "nitro_idiot")
                  (:url "/id/2"
                   :name "meymao"))
          :has-next-page T))
```

If you want to get something from a database or execute a function using [Djula](http://mmontone.github.io/djula/) you must explicity call `list` when passing the arguments to render so that the code executes.

```common-lisp
(import 'myapp.view:render)

(render #P"users.html"
        (list :users (get-users-from-db)))
```

### JSON API

This is an example of a JSON API.

```common-lisp
(defroute "/user.json" (&key |id|)
  (let ((person (find-person-from-db |id|)))
    ;; person => (:|name| "Eitaro Fukamachi" :|email| "e.arrows@gmail.com")
    (render-json person)))

;=> {"name":"Eitaro Fukamachi","email":"e.arrows@gmail.com"}
```

`render-json` is a part of a skeleton project. You can find its code in "src/view.lisp".

### Static file

Images, CSS, JS, favicon.ico and robot.txt in "static/" directory will be served by default.

```
/images/logo.png => {PROJECT_ROOT}/static/images/logo.png
/css/main.css    => {PROJECT_ROOT}/static/css/main.css
/js/app/index.js => {PROJECT_ROOT}/static/js/app/index.js
/robot.txt       => {PROJECT_ROOT}/static/robot.txt
/favicon.ico     => {PROJECT_ROOT}/static/favicon.ico
```

You can change these rules by rewriting "PROJECT_ROOT/app.lisp". See [Clack.Middleware.Static](http://quickdocs.org/clack/api#package-CLACK.MIDDLEWARE.STATIC) for detail.

### Configuration

Caveman adopts [Envy](https://github.com/fukamachi/envy) as a configuration switcher. This allows definition of  multiple configurations and switching between them according to an environment variable.

This is a typical example:

```common-lisp
(defpackage :myapp.config
  (:use :cl
        :envy))
(in-package :myapp.config)

(setf (config-env-var) "APP_ENV")

(defconfig :common
  `(:application-root ,(asdf:component-pathname (asdf:find-system :myapp))))

(defconfig |development|
  `(:debug T
    :databases
    ((:maindb :sqlite3 :database-name ,(merge-pathnames #P"test.db"
                                                        *application-root*)))))

(defconfig |production|
  '(:databases
    ((:maindb :mysql :database-name "myapp" :username "whoami" :password "1234")
     (:workerdb :mysql :database-name "jobs" :username "whoami" :password "1234"))))

(defconfig |staging|
  `(:debug T
    ,@|production|))
```

Every configuration is a property list. You can choose the configuration which to use by setting `APP_ENV`.

To get a value from the current configuration, call `myapp.config:config` with the key you want.

```common-lisp
(import 'myapp.config:config)

(setf (osicat:environment-variable "APP_ENV") "development")
(config :debug)
;=> T
```

### Database

When you add `:databases` to the configuration, Caveman enables database support. `:databases` is an association list of database settings.

```common-lisp
(defconfig |production|
  '(:databases
    ((:maindb :mysql :database-name "myapp" :username "whoami" :password "1234")
     (:workerdb :mysql :database-name "jobs" :username "whoami" :password "1234"))))
```

`db` in a package `myapp.db` is a function for connecting to each databases configured the above. Here is an example.

```common-lisp
(use-package '(:myapp.db :sxql :datafly))

(defun search-adults ()
  (with-connection (db)
    (retrieve-all
      (select :*
        (from :person)
        (where (:>= :age 20))))))
```

The connection is alive during the Lisp session, and will be reused in every HTTP request.

`retrieve-all` and the query language came from [datafly](https://github.com/fukamachi/datafly) and [SxQL](https://github.com/fukamachi/sxql). See those sets of documentation for more information.

### Set HTTP headers or HTTP status

There are several special variables available during a HTTP request. `*request*` and `*response*` represent a request and a response. If you are familiar with [Clack](http://clacklisp.org/), these are instances of subclasses of [Clack.Request](http://quickdocs.org/clack/api#package-CLACK.REQUEST) and [Clack.Response](http://quickdocs.org/clack/api#package-CLACK.RESPONSE).

```common-lisp
(use-package :caveman2)

;; Get a value of Referer header.
(http-referer *request*)

;; Set Content-Type header.
(setf (getf (response-headers *response*) :content-type) "application/json")

;; Set HTTP status.
(setf (status *response*) 304)
```

If you would like to set Content-Type "application/json" for all "*.json" requests, `next-route` can be used.

```common-lisp
(defroute "/*.json" ()
  (setf (getf (response-headers *response*) :content-type) "application/json")
  (next-route))

(defroute "/user.json" () ...)
(defroute "/search.json" () ...)
(defroute ("/new.json" :method :POST) () ...)
```

### Using session

Session data is for memorizing user-specific data. `*session*` is a hash table that stores session data.

This example increments `:counter` in the session, and displays it for each visitor.

```common-lisp
(defroute "/counter" ()
  (format nil "You came here ~A times."
          (incf (gethash :counter *session* 0))))
```

Caveman2 stores session data in-memory by default. To change this, specify `:store` to `:session` in "PROJECT_ROOT/app.lisp".

This example uses RDBMS to store session data.

```diff
      '(:backtrace
        :output (getf (config) :error-log))
      nil)
- :session
+ (:session
+  :store (make-dbi-store :connector (lambda ()
+                                      (apply #'dbi:connect
+                                             (myapp.db:connection-settings)))))
  (if (productionp)
      nil
      (lambda (app)
```

NOTE: Don't forget to add `:lack-session-store-dbi` as `:depends-on` of your app. It is not a part of Clack/Lack.

See the source code of Lack.Session.Store.DBi for more information.

- [Lack.Session.Store.Dbi](https://github.com/fukamachi/lack/blob/master/src/middleware/session/store/dbi.lisp)

### Throw an HTTP status code

```common-lisp
(import 'caveman2:throw-code)

(defroute ("/auth" :method :POST) (&key |name| |password|)
  (unless (authorize |name| |password|)
    (throw-code 403)))
```

### Specify error pages

To specify error pages for 404, 500 or such, define a method `on-exception` of your app.

```common-lisp
(defmethod on-exception ((app <web>) (code (eql 404)))
  (declare (ignore app code))
  (merge-pathnames #P"_errors/404.html"
                   *template-directory*))
```


### Hot Deployment

Though Caveman doesn't have a feature for hot deployment, [Server::Starter](http://search.cpan.org/~kazuho/Server-Starter-0.15/lib/Server/Starter.pm) -- a Perl module -- makes it easy.

    $ APP_ENV=production start_server --port 8080 -- clackup --server :fcgi app.lisp

NOTE: Server::Starter requires the server to support binding on a specific fd, which means only `:fcgi` and `:woo` are the ones work with `start_server` command.

To restart the server, send HUP signal (`kill -HUP <pid>`) to the `start_server` process.

### Error Log

Caveman outputs error backtraces to a file which is specified at `:error-log` in your configuration.

```common-lisp
(defconfig |default|
  `(:error-log #P"/var/log/apps/myapp_error.log"
    :databases
    ((:maindb :sqlite3 :database-name ,(merge-pathnames #P"myapp.db"
                                                        *application-root*)))))
```

## Use another templating library

### CL-WHO

```common-lisp
(import 'cl-who:with-html-output-to-string)

(defroute "/" ()
  (with-html-output-to-string (output nil :prologue t)
    (:html
      (:head (:title "Welcome to Caveman!"))
      (:body "Blah blah blah."))))
;=> "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">
;   <html><head><title>Welcome to Caveman!</title></head><body>Blah blah blah.</body></html>"
```

* [CL-WHO Website](http://weitz.de/cl-who/)

### CL-Markup

```common-lisp
(import 'cl-markup:xhtml)

(defroute "/" ()
  (xhtml
    (:head (:title "Welcome to Caveman!"))
    (:body "Blah blah blah.")))
;=> "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd\"><html><head><title>Welcome to Caveman!</title></head><body>Blah blah blah.</body></html>"
```

* [CL-Markup repository](https://github.com/arielnetworks/cl-markup)

### cl-closure-template

```html
{namespace myapp.view}

{template renderIndex}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>"Welcome to Caveman!</title>
</head>
<body>
  Blah blah blah.
</body>
</html>
{/template}
```

```common-lisp
(import 'myapp.config:*template-directory*)

(closure-template:compile-cl-templates (merge-pathnames #P"index.tmpl"
                                                        *template-directory*))

(defroute "/" ()
  (myapp.view:render-index))
```

## Use another database library

### CLSQL

You can use Lack.Middleware.Clsql to use CLSQL in Clack compliant application.

In Caveman, add the middleware to `builder` in "PROJECT_ROOT/app.lisp".

```common-lisp
(ql:quickload :clack-middleware-clsql)
(import 'clack.middleware.clsql:<clack-middleware-clsql>)

(builder
 (<clack-middleware-clsql>
  :database-type :mysql
  :connection-spec '("localhost" "db" "fukamachi" "password"))
 *web*)
```

* [Clack.Middleware.Clsql](http://quickdocs.org/clack/api#system-clack-middleware-clsql)
* [CLSQL: Common Lisp SQL Interface](http://clsql.b9.com/)

### Postmodern

You can use Clack.Middleware.Postmodern to use Postmodern in Clack compliant application.

In Caveman, add the middleware to `builder` in "PROJECT_ROOT/app.lisp".


```common-lisp
(ql:quickload :clack-middleware-postmodern)
(import 'clack.middleware.postmodern:<clack-middleware-postmodern>)

(builder
 (<clack-middleware-postmodern>
  :database "database-name"
  :user "database-user"
  :password "database-password"
  :host "remote-address")
 *web*)
```
